## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Each layer imports only its own peers and the layers beneath it
`src/pi/` SHALL import only `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, Node builtins, the core directories and itself. `src/claude-code/` adds `src/pi/`. `src/durable/` adds `@earendil-works/pi-durable`, `@earendil-works/chord`, `src/claude-code/` and `src/openspec/`. Only `src/cloudflare/` SHALL import `agents` or `cloudflare:workers`, and it adds `src/durable/`. `src/openspec/` SHALL import only `zod` and itself. `src/bin/` may import any layer.

#### Scenario: The layer graph holds
- **WHEN** every import under `src/pi/`, `src/claude-code/`, `src/durable/`, `src/cloudflare/` and `src/openspec/` is reduced to a package name or a top-level `src/` directory
- **THEN** each directory's set SHALL be within the set this requirement allows it
- **AND** the scan SHALL have read at least one file in each directory

#### Scenario: Nothing outside cloudflare touches Workers
- **WHEN** every file under `src/` except `src/cloudflare/` is scanned
- **THEN** none SHALL import `agents`, `agents/*` or `cloudflare:workers`

#### Scenario: The durable layer records with the ontology
- **WHEN** the imports under `src/durable/` are reduced
- **THEN** they SHALL include `src/openspec`, the ontology its host actions build their Action and Evidence records with
- **AND** they SHALL NOT include `zod`, which only `src/openspec/` imports
